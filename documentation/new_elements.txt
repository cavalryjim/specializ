Basic documentation for creating and approving newly submitted elements.

Here are the fields we have to work with:
element.current
iteration_list.include
iteration_list.new_element


User submits a new element.
iteration_list.include = false
iteration_list.new_element = true
element.current = false

Manager approves element (change include and current to true).
iteration_list.include = true
iteration_list.new_element = true
element.current = true

Manager disapproves element (leave include as false).
iteration_list.include = false
iteration_list.new_element = true
element.current = false

Start new iteration (change new_element to false if include = true...else delete element).
iteration_list.include = true
iteration_list.new_element = false
element.current = true
